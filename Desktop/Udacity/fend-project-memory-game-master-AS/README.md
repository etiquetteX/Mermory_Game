# Memory Game Project

Memory Game is a card matching game built as an exercise in front-end web-development.
At the start of the game, all cards are faced down and placed in a random position.
The goal of the game is to open pairs of cards until all cards are matched, in the shortest amount of time and by avoiding to lose stars when accumulating too many consecutive 'unmatched' pairs.

## Getting Started

Clone the GitHub repository and get playing by opening the index.html file in a browser. You will need an internet connection for some of the CSS elements to load properly.
